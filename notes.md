### Certs used in tests generated by running:
> ./scripts/generateCerts.sh . questdbPwd123

### TODO:
- Test the client against a real QuestDB instance, not only mock.
  The easiest way to do it is to use https://www.npmjs.com/package/testcontainers
- Would be nice to accept alternative logger implementations to be used instead of console
- If the buffer had to be extended, shrink it back to original size on a subsequent flush() call?
